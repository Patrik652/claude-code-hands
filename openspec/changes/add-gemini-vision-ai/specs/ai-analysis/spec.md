# AI-Powered Screen Analysis

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Semantic Screen Analysis
The system SHALL provide AI-powered semantic understanding of screen content using multimodal vision models.

#### Scenario: Analyze UI element purpose
- **GIVEN** a screenshot containing UI elements
- **WHEN** user requests `analyze_screen()` with prompt "What buttons are available?"
- **THEN** system returns structured analysis identifying buttons with their labels and likely purposes
- **AND** response includes confidence scores for identified elements

#### Scenario: Interpret complex layouts
- **GIVEN** a screenshot of a web form
- **WHEN** user requests analysis with prompt "Identify all input fields and their labels"
- **THEN** system returns list of form fields with associated labels, types, and requirements
- **AND** system indicates which fields are mandatory vs optional

#### Scenario: Understand visual context
- **GIVEN** a screenshot showing an error dialog
- **WHEN** user requests `analyze_screen()` with prompt "What error is shown?"
- **THEN** system extracts error message, severity, and suggested actions
- **AND** provides actionable recommendations for resolution

### Requirement: Intelligent Element Detection
The system SHALL identify and locate UI elements based on semantic descriptions rather than pixel templates.

#### Scenario: Find element by description
- **GIVEN** a screenshot of a desktop application
- **WHEN** user calls `find_element_ai(description="submit button")`
- **THEN** system locates the submit button using AI understanding
- **AND** returns coordinates, bounding box, and confidence score
- **AND** works even if button appearance differs from templates

#### Scenario: Locate elements with context
- **GIVEN** a screenshot with multiple similar buttons
- **WHEN** user calls `find_element_ai(description="save button in top toolbar")`
- **THEN** system uses contextual understanding to identify correct button
- **AND** differentiates from other save buttons in different locations

### Requirement: Content Interpretation
The system SHALL extract and interpret semantic meaning from visual content beyond raw OCR.

#### Scenario: Understand table data
- **GIVEN** a screenshot showing a data table
- **WHEN** user requests `interpret_content(prompt="What is the total revenue?")`
- **THEN** system identifies table structure, locates revenue column, and calculates total
- **AND** returns formatted result with source data context

#### Scenario: Extract actionable information
- **GIVEN** a screenshot of a dashboard with metrics
- **WHEN** user requests analysis of "key performance indicators"
- **THEN** system identifies KPIs, their values, trends, and status (good/bad/warning)
- **AND** provides insights about metric relationships

### Requirement: Multi-Image Analysis
The system SHALL analyze multiple screenshots together to understand workflows and sequences.

#### Scenario: Compare before/after states
- **GIVEN** two screenshots from different time points
- **WHEN** user calls `compare_screens(before, after, prompt="What changed?")`
- **THEN** system identifies visual differences and their semantic meaning
- **AND** explains what user actions might have caused the changes

#### Scenario: Understand multi-step process
- **GIVEN** sequence of 3-5 screenshots showing a workflow
- **WHEN** user requests `analyze_sequence(images, "Document the workflow steps")`
- **THEN** system describes each step and transitions between states
- **AND** identifies user actions required at each stage

### Requirement: Response Formatting
The system SHALL return AI analysis in structured, parseable formats compatible with MCP protocol.

#### Scenario: Structured JSON responses
- **GIVEN** any AI analysis request
- **WHEN** system completes analysis
- **THEN** response includes structured fields: analysis text, identified elements (with coordinates), confidence scores, and metadata
- **AND** response conforms to MCP tool response schema

#### Scenario: Error handling
- **GIVEN** AI analysis request that fails (network error, invalid image, etc.)
- **WHEN** error occurs during processing
- **THEN** system returns structured error with category, message, and retry suggestions
- **AND** logs error details for debugging without exposing sensitive API information

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize AI API usage to minimize latency and respect rate limits.

#### Scenario: Image compression for API
- **GIVEN** a high-resolution screenshot (4K+)
- **WHEN** preparing for AI analysis
- **THEN** system intelligently compresses image while preserving relevant details
- **AND** compression targets optimal balance between quality and API token usage
- **AND** compression settings are configurable

#### Scenario: Caching analysis results
- **GIVEN** identical screenshot analyzed previously
- **WHEN** same analysis requested within cache TTL (configurable, default 5 minutes)
- **THEN** system returns cached result without API call
- **AND** cache invalidation considers screenshot similarity threshold

#### Scenario: Batch processing optimization
- **GIVEN** multiple analysis requests queued
- **WHEN** requests can be combined (same image, related questions)
- **THEN** system batches compatible requests into single API call
- **AND** distributes results back to respective requesters
